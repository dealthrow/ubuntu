In Linux, these processes are divided into 3 types of processes: Interactive, Batch and Daemon.

The processes which are not associated with the command line and are presented from a queue of processes,
which are also most convenient for recurring tasks during the time when the system usage is low is called the BATCH PROCESS.

The process which is identified by the system and whose PID is always ‘init’, is called as DAEMON
. 
The ‘init’ is a process which always gets started first at the time when a Linux computer is turned on and it remains on that system until the computer is turned off.

The Processes due to which Daemons get initiated are forking, making a parent process die when the child process starts performing their normal functions.
